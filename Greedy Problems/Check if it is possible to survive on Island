Ishika got stuck on an island. There is only one shop on this island and it is open on all days of the week except for Sunday. Consider following constraints:

N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Currently, it’s Monday, and she needs to survive for the next S days.
Find the minimum number of days on which you need to buy food from the shop so that she can survive the next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive

Code:

class Solution{
public:
    int minimumDays(int S, int N, int M){
        // code here
        int sundays = S/7;
        int buyingdays = S-sundays;
        int totalfood = S*M;
        int ans = 0;
        if(totalfood%N == 0){
            ans = totalfood/N;
        }
        else{
            ans = totalfood/N+1;
        }
        if(ans <= buyingdays){
            return ans;
        }
        else{
            return -1;
        }
    }
};
